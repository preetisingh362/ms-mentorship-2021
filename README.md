# getting started
Download this source code and open it in any editor (I used Vs-code). open teminal and run the command npm install.
This will install all the dependencies installed in package.json file into your system .(Make sure you have node js already installed in your device).
Now you are good to go!!!
Type npm server in your terminal -this will start the server at port 100.
If port number 100 is not available into your syystem you can change the port number!
Now open any browser(prefer chrome) and type localhost:100
Boom!!! your project runs!
